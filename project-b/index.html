    <p> China's living heritage is not a relic of the past, but a dynamic, evolving, and deeply relevant part of our
      contemporary world.</p>
    <p>"ICH Footsteps" is an interactive journey exploring China's Intangible Cultural Heritage through digital art.
      Players navigate a path discovering three traditional crafts: Iron Blossom that illuminate festivals
      with cascading sparks, Indigo Dyeing's flowing blue patterns that represent ancient textile mastery, and the
      Pentatonic Scale that transforms names into melodies using traditional Chinese five-note music theory. Each
      experience offers hands-on interaction, allowing users to create their own interpretations of these time-honored
      traditions. This project bridges ancient craftsmanship with modern technology, preserving cultural wisdom while
      making it accessible and engaging for contemporary audiences worldwide.</p>
